One day, on a calm midsummer evening, you recieve a letter in the mail from your dear friend Russell. You read over the envelope, discovering that Russell was inviting you over for a short vacation! "Just a few days, you've earned it!" as he had written. You smile slightly as you consider his offering.

A few summers ago, you had visited Russell in his rural town of Kirholm Point. It was a cheery little town with a population of 100. Everyone there knew one another and it provided a unique yet friendly experience.

After mulling it over a cup of tea, you came to the conclusion that you shall go.
